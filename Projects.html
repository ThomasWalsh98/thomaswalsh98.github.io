        <h1 style="font-family: 'Lucida Console', Monaco, monospace;">PROJECTS</h1>
        During my time at university, I have completed modules in the following topics:
        <ul class="modules">
            <li>Databases</li>
            <li>Software Engineering</li>
            <li>Object Orientated Software Design and Development</li>
            <li>Algorithmics and Logical Methods</li>
            <li>Computing Architecture and Operating Systems</li>
            <li>Internet Programming</li>
            <li>Object Orientated Programming - Java</li>
            <li>Computer Networks and Data Collection</li>
            <li>Enterprise Java Programming</li>
            <li>Human Computer Interaction</li>
            <li>Humanities Applications</li>
            <li>Multi-Media Development</li>
          </ul>

          
          These modules resulted in me achieving knowldege in Java, Python and C#. Experience using maven and JSON data was also attained.
          <br> Web developing lessons thought me how to use HTML,CSS, JavaScript and RestApis. Node.js and mongoDB were also experienced. Frameworks such as jQuery, Bootstrap and anime.js helped design web pages. PHP was learnt to complete a group project.
          <br> I have gained the skills required to analyse, manipulate and work with databases with SQL through mySQL and Microsoft Access.
          <br> The networks module has given me an ability to carry out Linux operations and create and run bash scripts.


          <h2 style="font-family: 'Lucida Console', Monaco, monospace;">Master’s Thesis: Vault Venture - AN FPS Video Game.</h2>
          As part of my postgraduate studies, I research video game developemnt and wrote a thesis about the impact of
          dynamic game balancing in video games. To test the hypothesis that dynamic game balancing improves the player's gaming experience
          by matching their ability to the game's difficulty setting, I fully developed a 3D first-person shooter game.
          <br>The game:
          <ul class="gameDetails">
              <li>Was built with the Unity game engine and the scripts were written in C#. </li>
              <li>The game features 5 uniquely built levels, with a Boss enemy to defeat at the end.</li>
              <li>The player was tasked with collecting key cards in levels while defeating enemies.</li>
              <li>At the end of every level, the player's perfomance was analysed using the dynamic game balancing system I designed. </li>
              <li>The AI-controlled enemies skillset would be alter during runtime depending on the player's performance.</li>
              <li>The game used a Raycast shooting system, collision techniques and spawning methods. </li>
              <li> A finite state machine model was designed and used to control the enemy’s animations and actions</li>
              <li>File reading and writing was used to log player performances, keep track of high scores and update the player’s progress. </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 style="font-family: 'Lucida Console', Monaco, monospace;">B.A.Final Year Project - Secondary Education Geography Aid Tool </h2>
          For my final year of my undergraduate studies, students were paired up with fellow students to collarborate on a year long project.
          <br> For my project, the title was "Software in Secondary Education". Both my fellow classmate, who I completed the project with, and I 
          were also studying geograhy as a second subject in our B.A. degree. Therefore, it was decided that the software would revolve around geography.
          <br> For the project, we:
          <ul class="gameDetails">
              <li>Created a web application that served as a resource to both students and teachers for the leaving cert geography curriculum. </li>
              <li>Website was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP.</li>
              <li>A database stored teacher and student login details and scores. On first visit, the user had to create a password that would be required for further logins </li>
              <li>The application allowed students to take several geography-based quizzes, viewing their past results and answers.</li>
              <li>Teachers had access to view all their students results through a teacher login page, where results were retrieved from a database using php.</li>
              <li>A 2D quiz game was also built using JavaScript and the Construct2 game engine to compare and contrast students experiences.</li>
          </ul>


          <h2 style="font-family: 'Lucida Console', Monaco, monospace;">Java Swing Projects</h2>
          <p style="font-family: 'Lucida Console', Monaco, monospace;"><b><font size="+2">Euro 2020 Sweepstakes Generator</font></b></p>
          Java Swing was taught as the Java GUI framework when I was taking classes in university. To practice making GUIs with Swing, 
          I decided to create an application that would randomly generate a pair that contained a person and a team competitng in the upcoming euros 2020/21.
          <ul class = "gameDetails">
            <li>The application used the borderlayout manager. This allowed for elements to be positioned independently in the north, south, east, and west sections of the window. 
              People were placed on the left and teams on the right, allowing for the center to be used as the position to show the results drawn.
              The south component was occupied with the button for the user's interaction.
            </li>
            <li>The application contains event listeners that allow the user to load a file up with people's names and a file containing all the team names.</li>
            <li>The application would parse the string contained in the files and stores the names of th epeople and teams in two separate arraylists.</li>
            <li>The lists would be sent to the GUI window to be displayed after being passed through a StringBuffer. When the button to draw a name is clicked,
              a method is called that randomly picks an index from the arraylist. The name is displayed in the center box on the gui and is removed from the arraylist and on screen list.</li>
            <li>When a pair is generated, it is written to a file that is created to store all the pairings. </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p style="font-family: 'Lucida Console', Monaco, monospace;"><b><font size="+2">Time Calculator</font></b></p>
          When collecting data for my thesis project, I frequently needed to manipulate time data. I discovered that 
          online resources were not sufficient and therefore I created my own application to carry out the work. Furthermore, I 
          then decided to create a swing application to manipulate time data for future references.
          <ul class = "gameDetails">
            <li>Java Swing has multiple layout managaers. This time I used the FlowLayout manager to postion all the elements of the calculator on rows. </li>
            <li>The time calculator uses textboxes that the user can enter the number of minutes and number of seconds into. </li>
            <li>The GUI window contains a togglebox of four buttons that represent the functions that can be carried out (add, subtract, mulitply, divide).</li>
            <li>The chosen togglebutton is highlighted to visually show the user the seledcted calculation. The togglebuttons are also eventlisteners that sets a variable in the code that is passed as a paramaeter so the correct method is called in the program.</li>
            <li>The time calculator allows for two times to be added or subracted from them other. </li>
            <li>It allows for one time to be mulitplied or be divided by a number entered by the user.</li>
            <li>A try catch statement is used to check to see if a valid number is entered into the textboxes. If an invalid input is detected, a popup box with a warning is displayed and the textboxes are reset. </li>
            <li>A clear button and result button are also eventlisteners that call methods. </li>
            <li>The clear button simplies resets the textboxes.</li>
            <li>The result button takes in the numbers entered as parameters and performs the corresponding method. The result is then returned.</li>
          </ul>
          <ul class= "gameDetails">
            <li>The time calculator also contains a button to access a "normal calculator".</li>
            <li>When clicked, a method to close the current GUI window is called, and a new Java Swing generated window is created that resembles a normal calculator.</li>
            <li>This calculator works as a basic calculator, with addition, subtraction, multiplication and division functions.</li>
            <li>Rather than textboxes, users enter numbers through the use of buttons that are all eventlisteners.</li>
            <li>The user's prompt is displayed on the top textbox and the result is calculated when the user presses equal.</li>

          </ul>
